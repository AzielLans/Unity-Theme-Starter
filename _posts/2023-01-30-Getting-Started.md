```
{: .nolineno}

and run
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Option 2. Forking Github

 then run:
```bash
$ bin/run insdep
```
{: .nolineno}

and run
```bash
$ bin/run server
```
{: .nolineno}

#  Upgrading
  Depending on how you use the theme:

- if you are using the [theme gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-unity). Run:

```bash
$ bin/run upgrade
```
{: .nolineno}

Please refer to the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/Involts/jekyll-theme-unity/wiki/Theme-Upgrade-Guide) to keep your repoâ€™s files in sync with the latest version of the theme.

- If you [forked](https://github.com/Involts/jekyll-theme-unity/fork) it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Involts/jekyll-theme-unity), then merge the [latest tags](https://github.com/Involts/jekyll-theme-unity/tags) into your Jekyll site to complete the upgrade. The merge is likely to conflict with your local modifications. Please be patient and careful to resolve these conflicts.
